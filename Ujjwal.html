<h2>About Myself</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Ujjwal Nadhani. I am a 13 year old freshman at Palo Alto High School. I enjoy anything tech related.</p>
<h2> Personality Traits</h2>
<p> I am a hard worker. I work diligently to accomplish all my goals. I generally don't give up very easily. If I enjoy something, I will give it by 120% effort. I am nice and I don't bite.</p>
<h2> Team Work Abilities </h2>
<p> I do play soccer, which is a team sport. I enjoy 
collaborating with others and adjusting to their talents, which helps us 
win games together. When it comes to iPhone projects, I prefer working 
alone. Recently, I have been doing an iPhone app project with a local gym 
coach. I enjoy working with him because I can get a new perspective and he 
helps me a ton. I have not made any enemies ever since Kindergarten. </p>
<h2>Other Hobbies</h2>
<p> I play 
competitive club soccer outside of school. I practice on mondays, 
wednesdays and fridays. I also have a weekend game. Apart from that I try 
to squeeze iPhone programming into my busy schedule. I will prioritize Team 8 should I get in.</p>
