<h1>Who am I?<h1>
<p>I am a sophmore here at paly. I would say I am friendly. If subjected to pressure, I can work efficient. <p>

<h2>Past Experiences<h2>
<p>I have been coding web based code for 2 years now. I know how to code HTML, php and mysql. Although I am familiar with HTML, being able to create a basic static webpage, I am better with manipulating information received from local systems. For instance, create webpages that can store information automatically using get() and post().
