<p>Robotics and programming in different languages have always been a passion that I want to pursue throughout my life. Since I was little, I have always had an interest in math and computer science. I hope to join Paly Robotics to further explore my interests in computer science and etc.  I am hardworking and passionate about being on the robotics team. I believe that I will make a strong impact this year. I hope to get more recruits on the web team next year. </p>

	<h3 style = "color: #FFF8DC;">&#9827;Paly Robotics Summer Camp</h3>
	<a href="http://palyrobotics.com/">Paly Robotics</a>
	<p>Over the summer, I attended the Paly Robtics Summer Camp and had a wonderful experience there. I learned how to code in html and css. I also learned how to sync code on github. Most importantly,  I developed teamwork skills. We made a website on a robot that we were supposed to sell. We named it the Green Gardener,a robot that helps families all over the world with maintaining a beautful environment at home. The website included a video we filmed, links to different sites and etc.</p>
	<h3 style = "color: #FFF8DC;">&#9827;CTY Summer Camp 2015</h3>
	<p>My passions about coding and programming brought me to join the CTY summer camp on Programming With Python. In that course, we learned how to program basic python functions and loops. </p>
	<h3 style = "color: #FFF8DC;">&#9827;Art of Problem Solving</h3>
	<a href = "http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/school/course/catalog/python1">Programming with Python</a>
	<p>I also have been learning python online on Aops. Art of Problem Solving's Online School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Most AoPS subject classes are UC a-g approved. I am planning to take the intermmediate class in the future.</p>

	<h3 style = "color: #FFF8DC;">&#9827;Java</h3>
	<p>Even though I have been programming mostly in python, I'm also interested in Java and other languages. This is the main reason why I want to join web. I want to have a wide range of knowledge on different languages and etc. Srcoll down to Final Statement for more details.</p>

<div class ="Teamwork">
	<h2 style = "color: #E9967A;">Teamwork</h2>
	<h3 style = "color: #FFF8DC;">&#9827;Leadership Qualities</h3>
	<p>When I think about working on a team, I think about taking the lead and communicating between each other. Throughout 8th grade, I have had many opportunities to be a leader and "take control". I took Leadership as an elective and developed many important life skills. On the robotics team, I hope to be share my experiences to my teammates. In the future, I want to take the lead in a project/work.</p>


<div class = "Final Statement">
	<h2 style = "color: #E9967A;">Final Statement</h2>
	<p>I want to learn how to further develop my skills in robotics and programming. Since I had previous knowledge on making websites through the Paly summer program, I have become really passionate on coding and designing websites. Therefore, I want to join the Web team. I believe that I will use my previous knowledge and motivation to improve our team. I’m looking forward to collaborating and interacting with fellow teammates to accomplish our goals throughout the year.
