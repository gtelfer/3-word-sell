			Hello, my name is Caleb and I aspire to be a member of the Paly Robotics Web team this year. Being from Silicon Valley, I have been exposed to many different STEAM experiences, and getting on the Paly Robotics team would allow me to further my interests in this field - all while having fun and developing close friendships in the process.

			<h3>Past Experience</h3>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
			Though a relative beginner in the aspects of coding and such, I do know some concepts from a wide variety of topics. For example, I have some experience working with SQL and sqlite3, I know a variety of Bash commands, and I know a small amount of Python coding. Through the robotics tryout, I was also able to expand my horizons and familiarize myself with some HTML5 and CSS. Additionally, I was on a First Lego Robotics team in where our team built and coded a robot.

			<h4>My Qualities</h4>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
			If I get on this team, you can expect me to bring positive qualities and a good teamspirit. As a freshman who is new to web design, I have a learning spirit, and I hope to learn everything that I can as quick as possible. Also, I will do my best to collaborate with my teammates - acknowledging their ideas and proposing my own. In short, I will work hard, pulling my weight as a member of the team.
