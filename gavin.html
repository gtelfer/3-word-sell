<p>Hi, Madiline, alex, and whoever else might read this.  I am a freshman at gunn.  I am nearly incapable of being energetic some of the time, and sometimes prefer to work alone, but I can work well with others.  I consider myself a nerd, but have a bunch of freinds, some of whom are as or skilled with computers as me.  In now bash, python, html, and css.
