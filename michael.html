    <div id="bio">
      <p> I'm interested in joining Web team because I'm considering a career in tech. I've taken up to APCS, and so the coursework has given me a good feel for computer science. However, it was mainly in Java, and I want to build on my knowledge by learning web and git in order to gain an edge for a career in tech. I like to learn collaboratively and in a hands-on approach. Thus, I'm passionate about joining Web team and working with peers to learn web development.
      </p>

      <p>
	I'm also experienced with communication and teamwork from leading two clubs (Entreprneur Club and NextGenVest) for 2 years; I've learned to smooth out differences and compromise for progress. (ahem, basically Henry Clay). 
      </p>

      <p>
	Thus, my passion for learning,which will drive me to work hard, and rich experience in teamwork make me a good fit for Web team.
